# The Anatomy of a CSS Selector

CSS selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style in a web page. They are a fundamental part of CSS, allowing you to target specific elements or groups of elements with precision.

## Basic Selectors

### Element Selectors
Element selectors target elements based on their ***tag name***. For example, to style all `<p>` elements:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```
This makes the text of all paragraphs blue.

### Class Selectors
Class selectors target elements based on their **class attribute**, using a period **(.)** followed by the ***class name***. For example:

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
This applies a yellow background to all elements with `class="highlight"`.

### ID Selectors
ID selectors target a single element based on its **id attribute**, using a hash **(#)** followed by the ***ID name***. For example:

```css
#header {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```
This sets the font size of the element with `id="header"` to **24 pixels**.

### Attribute Selectors
Attribute selectors target elements based on their ***attributes***. For example, to style all **<a>** elements with a target attribute:

```css
a[target] {
  color: red;
}
```
To target a specific attribute value, like `target="_blank"`:

```css
a[target="_blank"] {
  color: green;
}
```
### Pseudo-class Selectors
Pseudo-class selectors target elements based on their state or position. For example, to style links when hovered:

```css
a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```
Or to style the first **<p>** element inside its parent:

```css
p:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}

## Combinators
Combinators select elements based on their relationship to other elements.

### Descendant Selector
Targets descendants of an element:

```css
div p {
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```
This adds a left margin to all **<p>** elements inside **<div>** elements.

### Child Selector
Targets direct children using **>**:

```css
ul > li {
  list-style-type: square;
}
```
This applies square bullets to **<li>** elements directly inside **<ul>** elements.

### Adjacent Sibling Selector
Targets an element immediately following another using **+**:

```css
h2 + p {
  font-style: italic;
}
```
This italicizes **<p>** elements directly after **<h2>** elements.

## Grouping Selectors
Group multiple selectors with commas to apply the same styles:

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  color: navy;
}
```
This sets the color of **<h1>**, **<h2>**, and **<h3>** elements to navy.
